The problem is that that compiler first "strips" comments out of code -- i.e., anything starting in (IL:* --) is a comment.  This is done so that the common-lisp semantics of comments are preserved, viz, they are ignored completely, regardless of where they occur.Alas, LOOPS uses lists that start with * to indicate some things.  There was a patch made to the compiler to avoid stripping comments:(XCL:REINSTALL-ADVICE '(REMOVE-COMMENTS :IN COMPILER::PROCESS-FORMS)       :AROUND       '((:LAST (IF (EQ (CAAR XCL:ARGLIST)                            'DEFCLASS)                    THEN (CAR XCL:ARGLIST)                  ELSE *))))(READVISE (REMOVE-COMMENTS :IN COMPILER::PROCESS-FORMS))This should be in the latest sysout, dated 28 Aug 91.  --John*start*00817 00024 UU?Date: 14 Oct 91 10:40 PDTFrom: Michael Vines:IH:AILSubject: Re: Loops error message - Medley 2.0In-Reply-to: "welch@cis.ohio-state:edu:Xerox's message of 14 Oct 91 16:33 BST"To: welch@cis.ohio-state:edu:Xeroxcc: mike rattler!bane@cs.umd:edu:Xerox, mike, james, aisupport:mv:envosMessage-ID: <14-Oct-91 18:40:29 +1.Michael Vines:IH:AIL>Although this may workaround the problem, can you look into a 'proper' fix please.On the question of compilers, why are the library package, user packages and probably the medley sources compiled with the old compilers and not with the new compiler (LOOPS is compiled with the new compiler).  What are the major differences between code produced from the various compilers.  Which is more efficient ? What is FAKE-COMPILE-FILE ?RgdsMike Vines*start*01232 00024 UU?Date: 14 Oct 91 08:33 PDTFrom: welch@cis.ohio-state:edu:XeroxSubject: Re: Loops error message - Medley 2.0In-Reply-to: "Michael_Vines.IH@ail.xerox.com's message of Mon, 14 Oct 1991 06:39:07 PDT"To: Michael_Vines.IH@ail.xerox:comcc: rattler!bane@cs.umd, mike.IH@ail.xerox:com, james.IH@ail.xerox:com, aisupport:mv:envosMessage-ID: <<9110141533.AA08542@sacral.cis.ohio-state.edu>.?::><----RFC822 headers-----Received: from sacral.cis.ohio-state.edu ([128.146.61.208]) by alpha.xerox.com with SMTP id <11559>; Mon, 14 Oct 1991 09:03:22 PDTReceived: from localhost by sacral.cis.ohio-state.edu (5.61-kk/5.910703)	id AA08542; Mon, 14 Oct 91 11:33:53 -0400From:	Arun Welch <welch@cis.ohio-state.edu>-----RFC822 headers---->Sorry for coming into it this late, I've been at OOPSLA all last week,and they didn't provide for internet access.
